README Mycommands
=================

Summary
-------

Mycommands is a simple command line script (written in ruby) to organize and fetch your favourite unix/linux commands.


About
-----

Often when I need a solution for a specific task I do a google search to find out what command I can use. Before I made this script I had a text file with commands saved that I wanted to rember. 
This script makes it easier to fetch and organize my favourite commands.

Installing
----------

 * Clone or download the files. Install the required gems.
 * chmod u+x mycommands
 * Symlink mycommands to some directory in your path.
 * Linux users have to install xclip as well (you might have to install it from source).

Usage
-----

    $ mycommands
    
Use 0 (zero) to go back to the previous listing of categories and commands.
q will quit the script while browsing for commands.
