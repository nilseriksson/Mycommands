Summary
-------

Mycommands is a simple command line script to organize and fetch your favourite unix/linux commands.


About
-----

Often when I need a solution for a specific task I do a google search to find out what command I can use. Before I made this script I had a text file with commands saved that I wanted to rember. 
This script makes it easier to fetch and organize my favourite commands.

Installing
----------

See INSTALL file.


Usage
-----

    $ mycommands
    
    Use 0 (zero) to go back to the previous listing of categories and commands.
    q will quit the script while browsing for commands.
